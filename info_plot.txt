All the datasets will be plotted on the same graph.

This will open the histogram window which would allow the user to select which dataset to use. once the dataset has been selected using the combobox, click on the plot button will generate a graph within the window. Changing dataset and click plot again will refresh the graph. Clicking on cancel will close the window.
